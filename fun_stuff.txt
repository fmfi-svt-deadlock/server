Fun problems that I've overcome
===============================

- stateless is awesome
- avoid running around with secret keys by passing just a crypto black box (TODO but do it :D), and actually storing / loading the keys encrypted and decrypting only when really needed in order to avoid e.g. accidentally logging it (TODO also do it :D)
- extensibility + runtime configuration for packet types
- extensibility for "batch jobs" (e.g. for local dbs creation)
